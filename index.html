      <div class="job">
        <h3>Research Intern — IIT Madras</h3>
        <span>May 2025 – July 2025 | Chennai, India</span>
        <p>
          Applying 3D Gaussian Splatting to SPAD camera data for novel view synthesis and motion deblurring, aiming to
reconstruct clean, depth-rich scenes from photon-limited inputs. Developing gaze estimation models for lensless
imaging systems, incorporating differential privacy to safeguard sensitive visual cues. Engaging in model design,
targeted experimentation, and iterative refinement in collaboration with academic researchers.

        <h3>Research Intern — DRDO (Research Centre Imarat)</h3>
        <span>May 2024 – July 2024 | Hyderabad, India</span>
        <p>
          Worked on detecting anomalies in high-dimensional sensor data from defense systems, tackling the challenge of
identifying rare patterns in noisy environments. Developed and deployed machine learning models, handling the full
pipeline—from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model evaluation. Collaborated closely with senior
scientists to deliver actionable insights on real-world defense problems.

      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>First-Shot Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Addressed the problem of unsupervised anomaly detection in industrial sound monitoring, where only normal data
is available and metadata may be missing or noisy.</li>
            <li>
                Developed a patch-wise contrastive learning framework using a ResNet-34 encoder to learn fine-grained,
anomaly-sensitive embeddings from overlapping spectrogram segments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enhanced generalization across machine types by integrating metadata-aware attention pooling and early
attribute fusion into the representation learning pipeline.
            </li>
            <li>
                Achieved significant improvements in anomaly localization under domain shifts using Mahalanobis distance-based
scoring, outperforming traditional MSE and baseline Mahalanobis models.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mental Health Recommendation System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Addressed the challenge of early mental health diagnosis by integrating structured MCQ responses and
unstructured textual inputs, aligned with DSM-5 diagnostic guidelines.
            </li>
            <li>Designed and deployed a scalable ML backend using NLP models for abstract classification and traditional
classifiers for structured data, leveraging a dual-dataset architecture</li>
            <li>Achieved strong performance metrics: 91% accuracy in abstract classification, 86% for MCQ-based detection,
and 82% in multi-class classification, enhancing diagnostic reliability.
